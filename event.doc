=== Global events ===

Memory addresses $00E0 to $00FF are the system area, some of which are used
for global events.

$00E0
  Keyboard event at the beginning of each frame, if any key is pushed.
  Number pad are treated as numbers or arrows depending on num lock, but
  will set the direction even if num lock is on, unlike top row numbers.

  A key code can be a printable ASCII character or one of the following:
    8 = BACKSPACE
    9 = TAB
    13 = ENTER or RETURN
    16 = SHIFT+RIGHT
    17 = SHIFT+LEFT
    24 = UP
    25 = DOWN
    26 = RIGHT
    27 = LEFT
    30 = SHIFT+UP
    31 = SHIFT+DOWN

  W = ASCII code of key pushed
  X = X delta of direction (0 if not applicable)
  Y = Y delta of direction (0 if not applicable)
  Z = Direction (-1 if not applicable)

  Return = Unused.

$00E1
  Event called at each frame, after key (if any) but before everything else
  happens during this frame.

  W,X,Y,Z = Zero

  Return = Nonzero to skip the rest of the current turn (freeze time).


=== Script command events ===

A script command event uses the following registers:

W = Script XY record index
X = X coordinate
Y = Y coordinate
Z = Stat's speed

The return value is the new delay value; if it is zero then it will
continue executing the script.


=== Element events ===

In all cases, X and Y are the coordinates of the tile the event is for.

EV_FRAME (0)
  Called during each frame, on the scan of the board; this should not be
  used to move things around (use EV_STAT instead), but can be used for
  animation, changing this tile itself, etc.

  W = Kind
  Z = Parameter

  Return = Unused.

EV_STAT (1)
  Called whenever a stat's turn to be executed, before scripts.

  W = Stat number and stat XY index
  Z = Parameter

  Return = Nonzero to prevent scripts/delay.

EV_PUSH (2)
  Called when this object would be pushed.

  W = Direction
  Z = Parameter

  Return = Nonzero to prevent pushing.

EV_TRANSPORT (3)
  Called when this tile is hit by something attempting to be transported
  through it; only if A_TRANSPORTER attribute is set for this tile, and
  A_TRANSPORTABLE attribute is set for the object that is trying to be
  transported through it.

  W = Direction
  Z = Previously attempted target coordinates, or zero if none

  Return = Target coordinates; zero to prevent transport.
