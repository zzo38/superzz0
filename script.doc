=== Command syntax ===

@name
  Only allowed on the first line of the program. This will be the name
  which it can receive messages.

@name=kind
  Same as @name but you can specify the default kind (see below); this
  default kind cannot start with a at sign.

:label
  Make a label.

'comment
  Make a zapped label or a comment.

#command
  A standard command, or a user-defined command.

text
  Add text for a text window to be displayed. If there is only one line,
  then it is displayed in the message line instead.

$text
  Add centered text for a text window.

!label;text
  Link which, when selected will go to that label, and execute the code
  at that label.

!-help;text
  Link to a help file.

/dir
  Direction must be one letter, and it is possible for further commands on
  the same line (except labels). Otherwise works like the #GO command.

?dir
  Direction must be one letter, and it is possible for further commands on
  the same line. Otherwise works like the #TRY command, but you cannot
  specify a command to do if it fails to move.


=== Standard messages ===

:ENTERED
  Received by everything when entering a board.

:KEY_x
  Received by everything when a key is pushed, according to which key is
  pushed, which can be any letter or digit, or SPACE, RETURN, UP, DOWN,
  LEFT, RIGHT, or BACKSPACE.


=== Standard commands ===

Where another command is expected in these commands, the initial # is
optional, but it can start with a different sign if it is a command that
would ordinarily start with that other sign (e.g. a text box link), or
in this specific case it can start with = as a shortcut for #SEND, or
with " in which case it is normal text and " is ignored; however, : and '
are not allowed in this case.

#=[name:]label
  An abbrevation for #SEND.

#BECOME kind
  

#BIND name
  Changes this object to the stat of the specified name. On its turn, it
  will start executing from the beginning. (This works even if that stat
  currently has no XY records; this command will add one.)

#CHANGE kind kind
  

#CLEAR flag
  Clear a flag.

#CLEARALL
  Clear all named flags.

#CLONE dir [label]
  

#COLOR number
  Set this object's tile colour.

#CYCLE number
  Change the speed of this stat.

#DIE
  Delete this object and stop executing.

#DIEITEM
  Delete this object and stop executing, but also move the tile denoted by
  the first XY record of stat 1 to this object's location.

#END
  Stop executing this object.

#ERASE kind
  Erases everything in main and under layer matching that kind. If erasing
  something in the main layer, then whatever is in the under layer at that
  coordinates will be moved to the main layer.

#ESCAPE OFF
  Cancels a previous #ESCAPE ON; this is implied at the beginning of each
  (single line or multi line) text message.

#ESCAPE ON
  Allows further lines of this text message to contain {} which can be
  used 

#GIVE status_var number
  

#GO dir
  Attempt to move in the specified direction. If it cannot move, then it
  will wait until it is able to move, and then move.

#HELP help_name
  Display a help file, given the name of the lump without ".HLP" suffix.

#IDLE
  Skip a turn. (You can also use /I to mean the same thing.)

#IF condition command
  Execute the command only if the condition is true.

#IFNOT condition command
  Execute the command only if the condition is false.

#LOCK
  Lock the program from receiving messages.

#MISC1 number
  Set this stat's misc1 value.

#MISC2 number
  Set this stat's misc2 value.

#MISC3 number
  Set this stat's misc3 value.

#MUSIC bgm_name
  

#PARAMETER number
  Set this object's tile parameter.

#PLAY sfx_music
  

#PUSH dir
  

#PUT dir kind
  

#PUTAT number number kind
  

#RESTART
  Restart the program from the beginning.

#RESTORE label
  Changes all lines 'label into :label so that they will work.

#SEND [name:]label
  Go to the specified label, if it exists. If a name is specified, then
  affects all stats matching that name; in this case, it will not send
  to anything which is locked.

#SENDALL label
  Like "#SEND name" but sends to everything that isn't locked.

#SET flag
  Set a flag.

#SHIFT dir kind
  

#SHOW
  Show the text now, instead of waiting to accumulate further text.

#TAKE status_var number [command]
  

#TRY dir [command]
  Try to move in the direction; if it cannot go, then it will execute the
  specified command (or do nothing).

#WAIT number
  Wait for the specified number of turns (ignoring this stat's speed).

#WARP number
  Set a warp to the specified board (ends the turn).

#WHEN condition
  

#WHENNOT condition
  

#UNLOCK
  Unlock the program to allow it to receive messages.

#ZAP label
  Finds the first :label and comments it out by changing it to 'label
  instead, so that it cannot receive messages. If there is more than one,
  then only the first one with a colon is effective, so this command can
  be used to change which one is effective.


=== Conditions/flags ===

Some of these can be used with #SET and #CLEAR and #IF, while some are only
allowed for #IF.

name
  Any name not with a punctuation sign represents a global named flag. The
  name can be up to fifteen characters long, and up to sixteen such flags
  can be set at once.

#ALIGN
  True if this object is aligned with the player, either horizontally or
  vertically (not diagonally).

#ANY:kind
  Same as @kind.

#AT:number:number:kind
  True if specified kind at specified coordinates, in the main layer or the
  under layer.

#BENEATH:kind
  Same as B@kind.

#BLOCKED:dir
  True if blocked in the specified direction (i.e. it is the board edge or
  it is not a UNDER element).

#CONTACT
  True if this object is next to the player (not diagonally), or in the
  same cell (but different layer) of the player. (For this purpose, the
  "player" means any tile belonging to stat 1.)

#FULL
  True if no more named flags can be set.

#LOCKED
  True if this object is locked from receiving messages.

#MAIN:kind
  

#PLAYER:kind
  

#RANDOM
  There is a 50% chance to be true.

#UNDER:kind
  

#USER
  The user bit of this stat XY record.

@kind
  True if anything of the specified kind in the main or under layer.

B@kind
  True if a tile of the specified kind is directly beneath this object (in
  the under layer).

M@kind
  True if anything of the specified kind in the main layer.

P@kind
  True if any tile on the main layer belonging to stat 1 has the specified
  kind in the under layer.

U@kind
  True if anything of the specified kind in the under layer.

number comparison number
  True if the comparison between the numbers is correct. Do not put spaces
  in between; the above is only for explanation. The valid comparisons can
  be one of: = <> < > <= >=


=== Numbers ===

A number can be given in decimal notation (which must be a nonnegative
integer), or you can have an expression in parentheses. The expression is
alternating operators and operands. Operators are always left to right.

The valid operators are:

+ add
- subtract
* multiply
/ divide
% modulo
& bitwise AND
| bitwise OR
^ bitwise XOR
< left shift
> right shift
? random number in range

Operands can be a number, or it can be one of the following:

#A to #H or #S to #Z accesses a status variable
X or Y are the coordinates of this object
XX or YY are the coordinates of the player
M1 or M2 or M3 are the misc values of this stat
P is the parameter of this object
@name is how many objects (stat XY records) having the specified name

A number inside or outside of an expression can also be hexadecimal if
it has $ at first.


=== Kind ===

Where a "kind" is expected, it can be the name of a kind of element, and
can optionally be preceded and/or followed by <> with two hex digits in
between (the preceding is the colour and the following is the parameter),
and optionally followed by ! to mean only if it is a stat.

Instead of the kind of element, you may also instead use @name which is
the name of a program, if that program uses the @name=kind form, which
will create a XY record for that stat and use the kind specified there.
If the colour and/or parameter are specified here, they override those
specified in the other stat's program.

If the @name form is used for a match instead of creation, then it does
not need to have the @name=kind form (although it is still allowed); it
matches tiles corresponding to stats with that name.


=== Directions ===

It can be:

I or IDLE (don't move)
E or EAST
N or NORTH
W or WEST
S or SOUTH
CW dir
CCW dir
OPP dir
RANDOM (any of four directions at random)
SEEK (toward the player; random of two ways if not aligned)
SEEKNS (toward the player; north or south if not aligned)
SEEKEW (toward the player; east or west if not aligned)
